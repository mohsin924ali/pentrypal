# PentryPal Design System

## Overview

This directory contains all design-related assets and documentation for the PentryPal React Native application.

## Structure

### `/stitch-generated/`
Contains the original designs and code generated by Google Stitch:

- **`/screens/`** - Complete screen designs and generated code
- **`/components/`** - Individual component designs and code
- **`/assets/`** - Images, icons, and other visual assets

### Organization Guidelines

#### For Screen Designs
```
screens/
├── [screen-name]/
│   ├── [screen-name].png          # Visual design
│   ├── [screen-name].tsx          # Generated code
│   └── README.md                  # Design notes and specifications
```

#### For Components
```
components/
├── [component-name]/
│   ├── [component-name].png       # Visual design
│   ├── [component-name].tsx       # Generated code
│   └── README.md                  # Component specifications
```

## Integration Process

1. **Place Stitch Content**: Add your generated code and images to the appropriate folders
2. **Review & Adapt**: I'll help adapt the code to our architecture
3. **Extract Components**: Identify reusable components for our design system
4. **Implement**: Integrate into the main codebase following our patterns

## Next Steps

Please add your Google Stitch generated content to the `/stitch-generated/` folders. Include:

- Screen images (PNG/JPG)
- Generated React Native code
- Any design specifications or notes

This will help me understand your design vision and implement it properly within our established architecture.
